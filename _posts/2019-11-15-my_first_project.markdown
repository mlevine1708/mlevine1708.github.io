It took A LOT longer than I expected, but I finally completed my first project for the Flatiron School Web Development program.  Between working full time as an elementary school teacher, taking care of my 6 year old son, and a 1.5 year old puppy, finding the time to dedicate has been difficult, to say the least.  However, throughout the last few weeks, I've been coding when I can, watching many helpful videos through Flatiron, and getting help from the section leads.  

The purpose of the project was to build a Ruby gem that creates a Command Line Interface (CLI) that will collect data/information from an external source, like a web page.  The CLI is composed of an Object Oriented Ruby Application.

I decided to focus my project on Bruce Springsteen, as I am a gigantic Springsteen fan and thought that would be fun.  I wanted to create a gem that listed all of his albums for the user.  The list was scraped from his official website.  Once we have the list, users can select an album to learn more information about it.  Through this process, users can find out the album title, date released, URL for the album, producers, record label, and full description of the album.  

I used two scraper methods for this project. The first one got the list of albums from brucespringsteen.net/albums.  Each album was turned into an object through my Album class.  The second scraper got the rest of the information based on the user's selection.  That way I didn't have to scrape every single album, just the selections from the user.

For me, I think figuring out the correct syntax for everything was the most difficult part of this.  Still being a beginner with coding, it was a challenge to figure out how everything works together (the different classes, scraper, objects, etc.).  It's hard to describe how much I've learned from this process.  It's been my first big "test" on the road to being a web developer and while it took longer than I expected, and was more difficult than I could have imagined, I am very excited about this path I am on and can't wait to keep learning and coding!
