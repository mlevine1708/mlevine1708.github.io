After almost two years, I am finally in the home stretch of my Flatiron School experience.  There have been many ups and downs throughout this time and I find myself reflecting on how and why I started this in the first place.

In the fall of 2019, I had been an elementary school teacher for over 17 years, mostly teaching fifth grade.  As much as I loved working with my students, I had definitely begun to feel a little burned out.  I have always been a huge fan of technology and especially incorporating technology into the classroom - before the pandemic when everyone started doing it!  I hadn't done any coding previously, but I was intrigued by the idea and started exploring the concept of switching careers.

I don't even remember where I first heard of it, but I found out about a free coding workshop at this school called "Flatiron" in Washington DC.  I was excited about this prospect and decided to attend and see how I liked it.  Not even an hour into the presentation and I was hooked!  I had no clue what I was doing and probably didn't get much right that first day, but it was so amazing to see how things worked.

Fast forward a few months and after a few other workshops, I decided to give it a try.  I applied to the online self-paced program at Flatiron and was happily accepted.  I had hoped to do the full or part time program, which I thought would have been more effective, but I couldn't afford to just leave teaching to go back to school.

I started in June 2019 and now it's April 2021.  I am finally about to start my last project and just started working with a career coach.  I have gone back and forth so many times, debating what I want to do with my career, but I am very excited about the prospects of diving into the developer job search and we'll see what happens.
