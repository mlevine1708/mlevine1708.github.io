For my final project at Flatiron School, we were tasked with creating an app with a React/Redux frontend and Rails backend.  As with most of the other projects, this was quite a challenge.

I decided to keep it simple and make a basic blog site, where users can write about their favorite music, and create "Top Ten" Lists.  I used the "create-react-app" generator to start the project, which was very helpful, although I didn't need everything it came with.  I integrated react-router to have my three required routes - the main page, the individual posts, and an edit page.  

I used fetch to send the data back and forth between the Rails API, and used redux-thunk to assist in sending and receiving the data as well.

After slowly working through the curriculum over the past two years, I've realized that even though I enjoyed many aspects of this journey, coding full-time is not for me.  I am going to stick with my career as a teacher.   I am now teaching technology to middle schoolers, which was a change from teaching English, Math, etc. in elementary school.   This was a great change for me and I am really enjoying it, even if it wasn't the "big" change I was originally looking at.

Despite not making the career change I originally envisioned, I am glad I went through this program.  I learned so much and even though it didn't end up being a great "fit," it was worth it.
