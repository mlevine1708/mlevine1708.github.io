I started my Flatiron journal almost two years ago at this point!  I started in June, 2019 with the self-paced Web Development program.  I had been an elementary school teacher for 18 years and had all the intention of switching careers and going into web development.  The first few modules went well, even though my pacing was a little bit slow, especially with the projects.

I tried to time the program so that I would finish the following spring in the hopes of landing a position in coding at the beginning of the summer, so I would not break my contract with the school system (you had to resign by July 15 to be in good standing).  Unfortunately, life got in the way.  COVID and quarantine hit around the time I staretd working on my Rails project.  All of a sudden, I was learning to teach virtually and taking care of my 8 year old son.  So Flatiron took a back seat for awhile...

I returned from my "hiatus" in June, but it was really difficult to get back into things.  I had to relearn almost all of the Rails module to understand what I was doing.  I almost gave up many times, but I persevered and passed my Rails assessment, then eventually made it through Javascript, and I'm now finally at the tail end of the program - working on the React module and getting started with career prep.

This past summer, I accepted a technology teaching position at a middle school in my area and aside from the craziness of this year, it's been awesome.  I love teaching technology and coding, although it'll be much better when we're fully in person instead of virtual/hybrid.

So now as I'm finally getting towards the end of my Flatiron experience, I'm left with a debate of what to do with all this amazing knowledge/skills.  My initial instincts tell me to stay in teaching, but find a side gig doing programming.  I'm not sure how realistic that would be to find, though.  I am curious of what's out there in full time positions also, but don't know if I'm ready to leave the "safety" of teaching.  

We'll see what the next few months bring and I'm sure I'll have lots of inner debates with myself on what to do.  But no matter what I end up doing after Flatiron,  I am happy and proud to have persevered and continued through this program, no matter how long it took.
